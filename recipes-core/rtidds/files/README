This directory is used to hold the RTI installers.  On
this demo, the installers were called:

rti_connext_dds-5.2.3-eval-i86Linux2.6gcc4.4.5.run
rti_connext_dds-5.2.3-eval-x64Linux3.xgcc4.6.3.run

They cannot be included in this git repo because they
are not open source.  The developer must source
these locally with proper licensing.
